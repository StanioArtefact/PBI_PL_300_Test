"You need to create a report that shows the total sales amount for each product category, but only for products where the sales amount is greater than 1000. Which DAX function would you use to achieve this?",SUMX,FILTER,CALCULATE,SUM,CALCULATE,"The CALCULATE function modifies the filter context of a DAX expression. In this case, it applies a filter (sales amount greater than 1000) before calculating the total sales. SUMX calculates the sum of an expression over a table but requires an explicit filter or evaluation context. FILTER filters a table based on a condition but doesn’t directly compute a sum, so it needs to be used with CALCULATE. SUM calculates the sum of a column but doesn’t allow filtering before the calculation, making CALCULATE the correct choice.",

By creating a dedicated Date table, marking it as the Date table in Power BI, and linking it to the Sales table, you can easily perform time-based analysis (e.g., by month or quarter). Additionally, this approach helps to optimize your data model by making time-related calculations more efficient. Disable the auto date/time option: While disabling the auto date/time feature can help reduce the size of the model in some cases (since Power BI automatically generates hidden date tables when you use date fields), this won’t necessarily optimize your data model for analyzing sales by month and quarter. Disable the load on the Date table: Disabling the load on the Date table would prevent the Date table from being loaded into the data model, which would make it impossible to perform time-based analysis on the data (e.g., by month or quarter). Remove the relationship between the Product table and the Sales table: Removing this relationship would break your ability to analyze sales by product, which is not relevant to your goal of analyzing product sales by month and quarter.",
"From Power Query Editor, you profile the data shown in the following exhibit.",,,,,,,
The IoT GUID and IoT ID columns are unique to each row in the query. You need to analyze IoT events by the hour and day of the year. The solution must improve dataset performance. Solution: You create a custom column that concatenates the IoT GUID column and the IoT ID column and then delete the IoT GUID and IoT ID columns. Does this meet the goal?,Yes,No,,,No,"The solution does not address the need to extract the hour and day of the year from the DateTime column, which is essential for the required analysis.",https://img.examtopics.com/pl-300/image298.png
You have a CSV file that contains user complaints. The file contains a column named Logged. Logged contains the date and time each complaint occurred. The data in Logged is in the following format: 2018-12-31 at 08:59. You need to be able to analyze the complaints by the logged date and use a built-in date hierarchy. What should you do?,Change the data type of the Logged column to Date.,Split the Logged column by using at as the delimiter.,Add a conditional column that outputs 2018 if the Logged column starts with 2018 and set the data type of the new column to Whole Number.,Apply the Parse function from the Date transformations options to the Logged column.,Split the Logged column by using at as the delimiter.,"By splitting the Logged column into two parts — the date and the time — you can then change the data type of the date part to Date and use it in a date hierarchy. This allows for time-based analysis such as filtering by year, month, quarter, etc. Changing the data type of the Logged column to Date is not sufficient in this case because the Logged column contains a specific string format. Power BI wouldn’t recognize this format as a date by default, and you wouldn’t be able to use the built-in date hierarchy properly without first separating the date and time components. Adding a conditional column that outputs 2018 if the Logged column starts with 2018 wouldn’t help because it only extracts the year and doesn’t fully address the need to split the full date and time into separate components for analysis. Applying the Parse function from the Date transformations options to the Logged column would likely cause an error when trying to parse.",
