Which of the following modes allows you to directly connect to a data source in Power BI without importing the data into the model?,Import,DirectQuery,Dual,Live Connection,DirectQuery,"DirectQuery allows you to connect directly to the data source without importing data into Power BI. Import mode imports data into the Power BI model, which can improve performance but can be impractical for very large datasets. Dual is a combination of Import and DirectQuery, where some tables are imported and others use DirectQuery. Live Connection is a type of DirectQuery that connects to models like SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) or Power BI datasets, but the concept is essentially the same in terms of not importing data.",
You need to create a measure to calculate the year-to-date sales and to compare those sales to the previous year for the same time period. Which DAX function should you use?,PARALLELPERIOD,SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR,DATESYTD,PREVIOUSYEAR,SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR,"SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR, as it directly retrieves the same period in the previous year for comparison. PARALLELPERIOD does not dynamically return the same period from the previous year but instead shifts the entire period by a fixed amount. DATESYTD is used to compute Year-To-Date values within the current year but does not return the previous year’s YTD sales. PREVIOUSYEAR returns the entire date range for the previous year, rather than just the YTD portion.",
You need to create a measure that calculates the total sales from the equivalent month of the previous year. How should you complete the calculation?,CALCULATE - SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR - 'DATE'[DATE],CALCULATE - PARALLELPERIOD - 'DATE'[DATE],EVALUATE - SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR - 'DATE'[DATE],CALCULATE - SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR - 'DATE'[MONTH],CALCULATE - SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR - 'DATE'[DATE],"SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR is the correct function because it dynamically returns the same period (month, day, or full year) from the previous year. PARALLELPERIOD shifts the entire period by a fixed amount (e.g., 1 month or 1 year), but it does not guarantee that the returned range is the exact same period in the previous year. EVALUATE is used in DAX queries, not inside measures. SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR requires a date column ('DATE'[Date]) to properly return the same month from the previous year.",https://www.examtopics.com/assets/media/exam-media/04331/0008300001.png
"You need to create a report that shows the total sales amount for each product category, but only for products where the sales amount is greater than 1000. Which DAX function would you use to achieve this?",SUMX,FILTER,CALCULATE,SUM,CALCULATE,"The CALCULATE function modifies the filter context of a DAX expression. In this case, it applies a filter (sales amount greater than 1000) before calculating the total sales. SUMX calculates the sum of an expression over a table but requires an explicit filter or evaluation context. FILTER filters a table based on a condition but doesn’t directly compute a sum, so it needs to be used with CALCULATE. SUM calculates the sum of a column but doesn’t allow filtering before the calculation, making CALCULATE the correct choice.",
